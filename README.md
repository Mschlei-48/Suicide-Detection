# Project Overview

1. **Data Exploration**
The data was first explored and the results of the exploration are written in the ProjectTextClassifier file. The project uses texts from a csv file and from images.

2. **App and model**
This app classifies text as suicidal and non-suicidal using the Random Forest machine learning model. It also gives the percentage probability for the classified text so that a person can determine how sure the model is about the classification it gave and decode whether to take actions.The RealSources file is used for the cleaning and pre-processing  of the data given by the user for the app.
The app has 3 tabs. The first one gives instrictions on how to use the app. The second one is where a user can enter the text and click the submit button to get results. The third tab gives helplines for help in Northern Cape.
